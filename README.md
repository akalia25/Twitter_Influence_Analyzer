# Twitter_Influence_Analyzer
TLDR:
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to identify the impact Tweets have on politicians approval rating. 


ABSTRACT: 

On November 8, 2016 history was changed forever. Donald Trump, one of the most controversial political figures ever,beat Hillary Clinton in the United States presidential race. Throughout his campaign Trump had used Twitter to post various tweets that sparked outrage. This report attempted to find a relationship between Donald Trump’s tweets and his approval rating. After the models were built, run, and tested, they still had fairly low accuracy. This is due to the complex nature of Trump’s approval ratings, and that it is influenced by far more factors than just his tweets. While we originally thought that most of the things that happen with Trump will be tweeted about, we didn’t take into account any delay between Trump’s bad behavior and his tweets about it. 
We also hypothesized that his tweets often contain similar clusters of words, that are also common media headlines. For this hypothesis, k means clustering was used, and the 20 clusters that were gathered from his tweets were indeed all common news headlines such as “Trump Urges Russia to find Clinton’s Missing Emails” from CNN.
